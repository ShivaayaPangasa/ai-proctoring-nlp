# Interview Transcript Intelligence System

Real-time linguistic analysis of spoken interview responses using Whisper Speech Recognition, GPT-2 Perplexity Analysis, and NLP-based transcript intelligence.

---

## Overview

Interview Transcript Intelligence System is an end-to-end NLP application designed to analyze spoken interview responses and extract meaningful linguistic characteristics from candidate speech.

The system records audio responses, converts speech to text using OpenAI Whisper, computes multiple linguistic metrics, and generates a Preparedness Score based on transcript structure and language patterns.

Rather than attempting to claim whether a response was AI-generated, the system focuses on observable linguistic characteristics such as vocabulary diversity, sentence structure, repetition, formality, and text predictability.

## Metrics Used

### Perplexity

Measures how predictable the transcript is according to a language model.

Lower perplexity often indicates highly structured or predictable language.

### Vocabulary Richness

Ratio of unique words to total words.

Higher values indicate greater lexical diversity.

### Sentence Consistency

Measures variation in sentence lengths.

Lower variation may indicate highly structured responses.

### Repetition Score

Measures repeated word usage throughout the transcript.

Higher repetition may indicate rehearsed language patterns.

### Formality Score

Measures occurrence of formal academic and professional language markers.

Examples:

* Therefore
* Furthermore
* Moreover
* Consequently
* Hence
